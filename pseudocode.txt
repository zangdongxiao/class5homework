This python file is to manage dataset file. First is how to load the data firm the file, second is to organize the data in a proper way. And to calculate different summary statisics with the data visualization.

1.Load the data to the current directory.

2.1 Give data file a name
    Import argparse
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("my_file",
                       type=str, help="Path to the input csv file.")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    my_file = args.my_file

    import os
    import os.path as op

2.2 load the file to the python
    import panadas as pd

    data = pd.read_csv(my_csv_file, sep='\s+|,', header=None)
    print(data.head())
    print(data.shape)

3 To organize the data we can use print(data.iloc[?, ?]) ?= columns or rows need
  to display.

4 To compute summary statistics
  first we need to import numpy "import nummpy as np"
  to compute mean "print(np.mean(data))"
  to compute standard deviation "print(np.std(data))"
  to computr average "print(np.average(data))"


5 Visualize data
  we need to import matplotlib.pyplot
  for one feature:show histogram of one attribute and save it to the file.
  for two features: compare two different attributes and show them in
                    one figure and save it to the file.
